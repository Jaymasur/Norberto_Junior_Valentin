            <h1>Norberto “Junior” Valentin Obituary</h1>
            <h2>May 7, 1971 – September 1, 2025</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Norberto Valentin, affectionately known as Junior, passed away peacefully at his home surrounded by family on September 1, 2025, at the age of 54. Born on May 7, 1971, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Junior was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, son, brother, and friend, remembered for his generous heart, unwavering love, and the joy he brought to everyone around him.</p>

        <p>Junior dedicated much of his career to Medico Industries, now part of General Dynamics, where he was a hardworking and respected employee. His dedication to his work reflected the same values he carried throughout his life—commitment, reliability, and integrity.</p>

        <p>Above all, Junior’s greatest joy was his family. He was a devoted husband to Marisol Valentin and a loving father to Luis, Jorge, Jose, Joemar, and Jamaris. He cherished his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, whose laughter and love filled his life with immense happiness. Loved deeply by his family, he gave all of himself and asked for nothing in return. A life of love that will never be forgotten—a legacy of kindness, generosity, and warmth that lives on in every heart he touched.</p>

        <p>Junior was adventurous and fun-loving, with a unique passion for searching for Bigfoot and fishing. He was a God-fearing man whose faith guided his life and shaped the way he cared for others. He is also survived by his parents, Herminio and Heroilda Valentin, and his siblings, Jackie, Jeff, Damaris, and Ricardo.</p>

        <p>He will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved him. Though he is gone, his spirit and the love he gave so freely will continue to inspire, comfort, and guide his family and friends for generations to come.</p>

        <p class="footer">Family and friends are invited to pay their respects at E. Blake Collins Funeral Home on Thursday, September 4, 2025, from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. A funeral service will be held at the funeral home on Friday, September 5, 2025, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., followed by interment at Maple Hill Cemetery.</p>
